An app for distributing privacy tools to your visitors on the one year anniversary of the first NSA revelations. 

This app lets you automatically add Reset The Net modal to your site on June 5, 2014. Reset the Net is a campaign demanding that web services take concrete steps to directly block governments' bulk collection of data, while encouraging the spread of free and open source privacy tools. The banner that your visitors would see encourages them to use [privacy tools and encryption](https://pack.resetthenet.org) to block government surveillance.

When web visitors see your banner, they can sign the pledge to use privacy tools to secure their privacy and demand other web services and companies do the same. 

Reset the Net was called for and organized by Fight for the Future, the digital rights group that launched the first protest against SOPA, and built many of the tools used on the Jan 18th SOPA blackout. Several other organizations such as ACLU, Demand Progress, Libertarian Party, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Our America Initiative, Popular Resistance, Free Press, Open Technology Institute, RootsAction, and Free Software Foundation and others have joined the effort. The world's biggest Internet companies such as Google, reddit, Mozilla and others are also joining the effort to promote privacy and block intrusive surveillance. For more information about the campaign, go to [ResetTheNet.org](https://www.resetthenet.org/)
